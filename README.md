# Assignment

## Notes

As for as I understood your task, Web Server doesn't touch the database, it only writes logs

It seems a little strange that parser has access to DB, and it has to send data to WEBrick.
So I'm in doubt if I understood it correctly

## To do

- Parse csv and create convinient data structures
- Write logic for checking if import data belongs to DB already
- Send new data to WEBrick
- Configure WEBrick to get Post responces
